      Welcome to my little internet hub. While you're here you can read my blog
      posts, or read more about me. It's up to you what you're interested in.
    </p>

    <p>
      I've been a Front-end Developer for over 7 years now and I've seen the
      field change from Gulp, to webpack, to full stack frameworks like NextJS.

    <p>
      At this very moment I work as a consultant, working mostly with the
      ReactJs ecosystem, but here in my blog you'll find more then just writing
      about React.
